Compile each file using `g++ std-=c++17 <file_name> -o <executable_name>`

1. Run the `tcp_server` executable: `server_executable <chosen_port>`. The connection must be successful.
2. In another tab, run the `tcp_client` executable: `client_executable <chosen_port>. After successfully connecting to the server,
send your desired message to it, or enter `stats` to get the total connections to the server and total messages sent for each client.

Note: this app was tested only on localhost
